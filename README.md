# Architectural Style Recognition

 Building Architectural Style Recognition Model using RBM

 In this example we will learn how to build Architectural Style Recognition using RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) as showcase for using Classical RBM compared to Dynex QBM (Quantum Boltzmann Machine)

 NOTE: this example is just for educational purposes and it cannot be used as standalone application due to insufficient data material
